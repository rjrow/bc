build_tables.R

This file is the start, it represents the entry of the data by line 12
and loads the file "clean_qualtrics_resource.R" for mappings and eventual objects I am going to need


wbc_to_db_v2.R

A ridiculous name but it does send all data to the database, it also generates the import_panel_csv. I have functions commented out that
name the succeeding process.


I will add more later.
